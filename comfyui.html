    <!-- Chosen Palette: Neubrutalist (Black, White, Pink, Blue) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as a single-page dashboard with three main, navigable sections: 'Market Analysis', '14-Day Learning Path', and 'Freelance Readiness'. This structure was chosen to first provide the strategic "why" (the market opportunity), then the tactical "how" (the daily plan), and finally the operational "what's next" (launching the business). This flow guides the user logically from understanding the landscape to acquiring actionable skills and finally to market entry. Interaction is centered around tab-based navigation for main sections and an accordion/collapsible interface for the daily learning modules, preventing information overload and allowing users to focus on one day at a time. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: In-demand freelance services -> Goal: Compare market opportunities -> Viz/Presentation: Horizontal Bar Chart (Chart.js) -> Interaction: Hover for details -> Justification: Clearly visualizes the most lucrative service areas, guiding learning priorities.
        - Report Info: Pricing benchmarks -> Goal: Inform on earning potential -> Viz/Presentation: Styled HTML table -> Interaction: Static -> Justification: Provides clear, easy-to-compare pricing tiers for business planning.
        - Report Info: 14-Day skill progression -> Goal: Organize a complex learning schedule -> Viz/Presentation: Interactive Accordion (HTML/JS) -> Interaction: Click to expand/collapse daily plans -> Justification: Breaks down the intensive schedule into manageable daily chunks, improving user focus and reducing overwhelm.
        - Report Info: Business readiness milestones -> Goal: Inform on progress and next steps -> Viz/Presentation: Checklist/Styled List (HTML/CSS) -> Interaction: Static -> Justification: Provides a clear, actionable checklist for launching a freelance career.
        - All choices are implemented using HTML, TailwindCSS, and Chart.js, confirming no SVG or Mermaid JS is used. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
